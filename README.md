# Inference_in_Temporal_Models
This project was my 3rd Homework for the course CMPE 480 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) at Bogazici University.

## About the Project
This project implements the relevant algorithms for inference in temporal models (Filtering, Likelihood of Evidence, Smoothing, Most Likely Explanation). Please refer to the project description for the input/output formatting.

## To Run the Code
One just need Python 3 to run the code.

So, simply run:

```python3 ozturk-volkan.py```
